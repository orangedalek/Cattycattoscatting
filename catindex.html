		<p>If you kill spiders instead of taking them outside, you're a spider murderer, but if you feed the spiders to your cat, it's the circle of life. Do not, however, try to recreate the "Circle of Life" scene from the Lion King by holding your cat above your head, or you will be badly scratched.</p>
